# LofAi
#### This is the project page for LofAi, an extension of [Musika!](https://github.com/marcoppasini/musika). 

#### For privacy reasons, I've opted to keep the model private for now, so this page exists to host some of the data filtering tools used in the project as well as showcase the results.

### Files
* remp3.py
	* convert batch files to mp3 with ffmpeg
* transcribe.py
	* data processing tool to identify music files with vocals using adjustable threshold  


### The final video project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpGc9_Q3QeE)
