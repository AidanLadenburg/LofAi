# LofAi
#### This is the project page for LofAi, an extension of [Musika!](https://github.com/marcoppasini/musika). 

#### For privacy reasons, I've opted to keep the model private for now, so this page exists to host some of the data filtering tools used in the project as well as showcase the results.

### The final video project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpGc9_Q3QeE)
